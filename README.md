"Hi, I’m Jose! I’m a chill guy who genuinely loves coding, but I enjoy the human side of tech just as much. While I value a quiet space to focus and get things done, I’m always up for a good chat and collaborating with the team. I have a background in Multi-platform App Development (DAM) with a focus on Java and Flutter. For me, it’s all about staying curious, innovating, and never missing a chance to learn something new."
